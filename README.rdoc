= Mingo

* https://github.com/chanks/mingo

== Description:

Mingo will eventually be a simple A/B testing engine for Rails 3 apps. It'll use MongoDB as a backend.

Honestly, the only reason I'm even putting it up on Github at this point is because my laptop's hard drive is making a slight grinding noise, and I want an easy backup.
